# Introductory Remarks 

## Physical Computing and Fabrication in the Arts and Humanities 

People often ask us what sort of arts and humanities projects involve physical computing and/or digital fabrication (or "computer numerical control" techniques). 

With that in mind, here's a list of related research areas. It's certainly not complete; however, I hope it gives you a sense of where the arts, humanities, physical computing, and fabrication come together.  

* Electronic literature (including the use of physical computing to create bots and interfaces) 
* Infrastructure studies (including "applied inquiry" into how hardware and infrastructure work as well as the politics of infrastructure) 
* Minimal computing (building software/hardware with a dedicated purpose, often with an investment in having it work across material/social conditions where access to infrastructure varies or is limited)
* Interactive installations (many art installations involve microcontroller platforms to respond to or track audience behaviours) 
* Wearables (most wearable technologies involve physical computing techniques) 
* Surveillance studies (investigating how the The Internet of Things is intertwined with social, cultural, and technical decisions, including decisions about how people are identified and how security operates) 
* Assistive technologies (researching norms around/in technologies + interfaces to then build alternatives, including alternatives by + for people with disabilities) 
* Preservation and restoration (many memory institutions use 3D scanning, modelling, and fabrication to preserve and exhibit 3D objects) 
* Rapid prototyping (as a method, rapid prototyping stresses the iterative development of ideas and things as processes that can be repeatedly shared with interested groups; this impulse works against interests in ideal or universal forms) 
* Prototyping the past (using physical computing and fabrication to remake artifacts that no longer exist or no longer function like they once did) 

## Some Ways to Frame Physical Computing and Fabrication through Theory 

* The digital is also physical (exceeds the screen or cannot be reduced to smybolic expression).
* Materiality and design are entangled with discourse (language and its conditions cannot be neatly separated from "technical" work) .
* Materiality and perception are embodied (to build interfaces and technologies is to frame or organize perception, with assumptions about people's bodies and behaviours).
* Physical computing and fabrication work across bits and atoms (we should ask how this becomes that, both culturally and materially). 
* Tools are not value neutral (they embody and influence culture, and they are congealed forms of labour).
